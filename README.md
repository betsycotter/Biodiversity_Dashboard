# Biodiversity Dashboard

## Summary

Roza and her team have been tasked to discover and document bacterial samples. They have collected samples from a number of individuals. The purpose of this page is to allow study participants to review their own biodiversity data.

In order to view their own data, participants are able to select their ID number from a drop down list. Once the ID is selected, the information will automatically populate. 

## Results

Three charts have been created to view the data: 
1. Bar chart
2. Gauge chart
3. Bubble chart
